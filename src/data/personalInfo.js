  bio: "I'm a passionate and curious Electronic Engineer from Naples, Italy. I'm highly involved in software development and solutioning on SAP ERP, software delivery with SAP Ariba and improving on web development and AI. The very crucial aspect of my job I like most is problem solving, both technically and functionally speaking. People coordination and knowledge transmission are not less important, because they deeply stress the role we all have as educators and shape somehow all the people we get in touch with.",
